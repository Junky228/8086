## 8086 Emulator
Prior to writing my Chip8 emulator, a suggestion was floated that
tumblrcode should try emulating the 8086 architecture.
It was discussed, and decided that first we should all make sure we
can write basic emulators so I went away and got my Chip8 one working.
Now the hour of our crusade has dawned, and the perilous journey through
8086 architecture manuals, instruction sets, opcode maps and datasheets
has begun.
